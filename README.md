RubyPress (Working name -- likely not the final one)
---------

RubyPress will be a fully featured blogging / cms solution that is designed to replace Wordpress and was started as a test
project where I could play with Ruby on Rails and learn it's ropes.  It's blossomed into something more.

My desire to do this stems from my wanting something that was 100% my very own from the ground up, not because I hate Wordpress
or anything like that.  Wordpress is a great blogging solution, it's just not "mine".

I'm still very much kicking the tires and tweaking things to see what they do and as such this isn't a stable product yet.
But I have high hopes.

Note;  I started this sucker when I was first learning Ruby so a lot of the code needs improvement and it causes me to cringe
looking at it today =)
